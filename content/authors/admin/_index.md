    # summary: |
    #   Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a second-year ELLIS PhD student at the Centre for [AI-FUn](https://www.ai-fun.manchester.ac.uk/research/) at University of Manchester and [ELLIS Unit Manchester](https://ellis.eu/units/manchester), where I am profoundly privileged to be under the mentorship of [Prof Samuel Kaski](https://kaski-lab.com/) and [Dr Sabina Sloman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eRBM_UcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Michele Caprio](https://michelecaprio.wixsite.com/caprio).
Under ELLIS program, I am also fortunate to have [Dr Luigi Acerbi](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/machine-and-human-intelligence) at the University of Helsinki as my second advisor.
My PhD research focuses on Bayesian Optimal Experimetal Design under model misspecification.

Before starting PhD journey, I obtained the Master degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the University of Zhejiang Sci-tech University under [Prof Qiaoling Zhang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085872337).
